  <p>BOOSTER is a new method to compute bootstrap-based branch supports. BOOSTER is an alternative and more informative method to calculate branch supports in large trees, than the "classical" Felsensteins bootstrap method.</p>
  <p>BOOSTER approach has a simple but sound statistical basis. It replaces the branch presence proportion (i.e. the expectation of a {0,1} indicator function) of Felsensteins bootstrap, by the expectation of a refined, gradual function in the [0,1] range, quantifying the branch presence in the bootstrap trees.</p>
  <p>BOOSTER is especially relevant with deep branches and large datasets, where branches known to be (nearly) correct are supported by transfer bootstrap while they are not by Felsensteins method. Though higher, BOOSTER supports are not impeded with falsely supported branches.</p>
