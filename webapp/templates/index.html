  <p>BOOSTER is an alternative and more informative method to calculate bootstrap branch supports in large trees, than the "classical" Felsenstein's bootstrap method.</p>
  <p>BOOSTER approach has a simple but sound statistical basis. It replaces the branch presence proportion (i.e. the expectation of a {0,1} indicator function) of Felsenstein's bootstrap, by the expectation of a refined, gradual function in the [0,1] range, quantifying the branch presence in the bootstrap trees.</p>
  <p>BOOSTER is especially relevant with deep branches and large datasets, where branches known to be (nearly) correct are supported by transfer bootstrap while they are not by Felsenstein's method. Though higher, BOOSTER supports are not impeded with falsely supported branches.</p>
  
  <p>
    To run BOOSTER you need two files, one with the reference tree inferred using your favorite method, the second with the bootstrap trees inferred using the same method from the bootstrapped alignments.
